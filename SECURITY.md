# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories or by contacting the maintainers (see repository owner profile). Do **not** open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.
- Include: affected version/commit, reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior, and any proof-of-concept if available.

## Supported Versions
- Active development branches (main and active feature branches) are supported on a best-effort basis until formal releases begin. Once versioned releases are published, we will list supported versions here.

## Handling Process
1. We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days.
2. We will investigate, develop a fix, and coordinate disclosure.
3. A patch release and changelog entry will be published; credit will be given if desired.

## Non-goals
- Do not use security reports for general bug submissions; file those via standard issue templates.
